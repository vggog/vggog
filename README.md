### Hi all <img src="https://github.com/blackcater/blackcater/raw/main/images/Hi.gif" height="15"/>

My name is Aidar.

I'm studying Applied mathematics and computer science program.

I currently live in Kazan, Russia.

At the moment, I'm well versed in the C# and Python programming languages, and in technologies for back-end development such as: SQL, HTML, Docker, PostgresSQL.

I'm also very interested in the topic of compilers and interpreters. I'm actively studying how they work.
